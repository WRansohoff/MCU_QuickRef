# Overview

This is just a quick reference to help choose the right MCU for a project.

I'll start with STM32 cores to put together a sort of test UI, then probably move on to SAM / Espressif / ATMega / etc. sort of chips.

I'm not sure if I should use Postgres to store MCU information, or just JSON files. I kind of like JSON.
